# Workout-Tracker

## Description

This workout tracker was created using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. The user is able to add exercises to their most recent workout plan, add a new workout plan, and view the combined weight and total duration of multiple exercises from the past 7 workouts on their stats page.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.
If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
