# Workout-Tracker
This workout tracker was created using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. The user is able to add exercises to their most recent workout plan, add a new workout plan, and view the combined weight and total duration of multiple exercises from the past 7 workouts on their stats page.
